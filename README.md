# Intro_Computing

A MATLAB final project for Introduction to Computing in the Biophysics department during my first semester at Johns Hopkins Univeristy.  

The project is to quantitatively analyze the trend in NBA using data extracted from ESPN. The MATLAB script takes in the data and plots out a line chart.

This is my first computer project. I got some help from Daniel Hsu and I had a lot of fun working on it
